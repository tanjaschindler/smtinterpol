\section*{Description}
\SI is an SMT solver written in Java and available under LGPL v3.  It supports
the quantifier-free combination of the theories of uninterpreted functions,
linear arithmetic over integers and reals, and arrays.  Furthermore it can
produce models, proofs, unsatisfiable cores, and interpolants.  The solver
reads input in SMTLIB format.  It includes parsers for DIMACS, AIGER, and
SMTLIB version 1.2 and 2.

The solver uses variants of standard algorithms for CNF
conversion~\cite{DBLP:journals/jsc/PlaistedG86}, congruence
closure~\cite{DBLP:conf/rta/NieuwenhuisO05}, Simplex~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/DutertreM06} and
branch-and-cut for integer arithmetic~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/ChristH15,DBLP:conf/cav/DilligDA09}.
The array decision procedure is based on \emph{weak equivalences}~\cite{DBLP:conf/frocos/ChristH15}.
%%   A new array decision
%% procedure based on \emph{weak equivalences} has been added to \SI for this years
%% competition.  Details about this procedure will be presented at the SMT
%% workshop.
Theory combination is performed based on partial models produced by the theory
solvers~\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/MouraB08}.

The main focus of \SI is the application track where the incremental
usage of the solver is required.  This track simulates the typical
application of \SI where a user asks multiple queries.  The main focus
of the development team of \SI is the interpolation
engine~\cite{DBLP:conf/tacas/ChristHN13}.  This makes it useful as a
backend for software verification tools.  In particular,
Ultimate\-Automatizer, the winner of the SV-COMP 2016, uses \SI.

\section*{Competition Version}
The version submitted to the SMT-COMP 2016 is a preliminary release of version
2.2.  This release will include quantifier-free interpolation for the theory
of arrays which is still missing in the current solver.

\section*{Logics, Tracks and Magic Number}

\SI participates in all tracks: the main track, the application track,
and the unsat core track.  It supports the logics QF\_UF, QF\_IDL,
QF\_RDL, QF\_LIA, QF\_LRA, QF\_LIRA, QF\_AX and every combinations of
these logics: QF\_ALIA, QF\_AUFLIA, QF\_AUFLIRA, QF\_UFIDL, QF\_UFLIA,
QF\_UFLRA.

Magic Number: $1\,953\,339\,634$
